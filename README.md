## Supervised Machine Learning Project - Regression &amp; Classification Modelling 

Problem Statement:
An investment firm is looking for opportunities to invest on equities with a horizon of 3 months. The firm is interested to invest in companies in specific industry sector when the companies declare their quarterly results. They would like to understand if the investment would bring them a minimum expected return or not. So, they are planning to form a team of data scientists to analyse and build ML models to estimate the quarterly return on investment in a company based on the company performance indicators and the external industry and economic factors.
